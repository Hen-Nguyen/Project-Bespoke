     <h2>Flashlights</h2>
     <h3>Light the way!</h3>

       <p style="margin-top:25px">I know what you're thinking to yourself... What is there to know about a flashlight? You switch it on and it lights up, switch it off and the light goes out. That's true for the most basic flashlights. Why would I even need a flashlight when I have a phone? In 2018, I was doing a lot of attic/crawl space construction, night-time walks, backpacking, and biking. I dug around in my knickknack drawer for my flashlights to find that half of them had either battery acid crusted on their contacts or was dissappointed at the amount of light they produced. When trying to use my phone light to see things, the light didn't travel very far and was awkward to hold. It was time to upgade! When looking for a new flashlight, I discovered that there is a huge community of people interested in creating the perfect flashlight. Just like keyboards, the perfect flashlight can manifest itself different forms and features depending on ones individual uses, needs, and preferences.

             <div class="col-lg justify-content align-self-center"><h5>Brief History</h5><p>The flashlights you may remember from your childhood were most likely simple on/off devices with very limited output (brightness). At the time flashlights like the 4D-cell and 2D-Cell Maglites were considered to be the best in terms of light output and build quality. Those flashlights used an incandescent lamp (hot wire filament producing light) and despite the size and number of batteries powering them; only produced around 80 lumens and a very yellow light tint. In 2001 LED bulb technology hit the market, boasting 100 lumens per watt, compared to 8-10 lumens per watt of their incandescent bulb counterparts. LED's were not only more durable and effiecient than glass bulbs, but they also were available in several ranges of color temperature and color rendering index (measure of the ability of a light source to accurately reveal the colors of various objects in comparison with an ideal or natural light source). The efficiency of LED bulbs made it possible to have good light output (100+ lumen) in smaller form factors. Although LED's were a big improvement in light output and form factors, many still only provided on/off functionality and produced 100-180 lumens using multiple AAA/AA, D, or button batteries.

             <div class="col-lg justify-content align-self-center"><h5>Modern Flashlights</h5><p>Fast forward to today, we have compact flashlights with output over 2800 lumens that light up a basketball court and can fit nicely in your pocket. We also giant hand-held flashlights that can light up a whole football field with over 100,000 lumens. Futhermore, newer LED flashlights can be programmed or have many modes and various output levels. This makes them much more versatile; you can use the same flashlight to read a book and use the same flashlight to light up your whole backyard. In the following sections, will go through some of the different types of flashlights and why you may want one depending on what you need it for.

     <h2>Different types of flashlights.</h2>
     <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block pt-2" src="Images\IntroLit EDC Example.jpg" style="width:600px"alt="EDC Sized Lights">
<ul>
<li><b>Compact/Everyday Carry Flashlights</b> These lights are manufactured with pocketability in mind first and performance second, but most of the larger options are perfectly adequate for house/car/camping/etc... uses. There are two main categories in this class: 18650 battery and primary battery (AA/AAA) powered flashlights. <ul>
  <li>18650 style batteries are very popular in the enthusiast community for their ability to put out a lot of power and runtime, while still being compact enough to carry in most pants pockets. They currently have the highest voltage and runtime capacity to weight/size ratio. They are also rechargeable with a 500+ cycle lifetime. </li>
  <li>Primary battery flashlights are also very popular. They do not have as good output or runtime, but are perfect for emergency situations where you need a light and can grab batteries that are laying around. On average their brightest modes can produce up to 252 lumens with a runtime of an hour and their medium modes can output 56 lumens with a runtime of 9 hours. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Right-angle lights and headlamps</b> If I could have only one portable light, it would be a right-angle light that functions as both an everyday carry light and a headlamp. Some lights in this form factor also offer a magnetic tailcap, allowing them to act as mountable area lights.</li>
</ul>
<img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block pt-2" src="Images\IntroLit Thrower Example.jpg" style="width:600px"alt="Big Lights">
<ul>
  <li><b>Duty lights</b> Most lights on the most of the lights previously mentioned are easy to carry, with their performance constrained by size and thermal mass as a result. Those are great for most uses, but there are also lights built for specific jobs and needs as well. Here are lights to bring when you know you'll be using them.<ul>

  <li>Throwers are flashlights with very focused beams that can illuminate things very far away. Characteristics of thow flashlights are deep and smooth reflectors which will help narrow the beam allowing it to keep the light in a compact area even at a distance.  The hotspots of these lights tend to be too focused for comfortable use up close, though using a diffuser is an option. These tend to be most useful for search and rescue, boating, and the like.</li>
  <li>Flooders produce a more scattered light which is great for seeing everything in the general vicinity, but not far away. Characteristics of flood flashlights are shorter reflector that are textured to disperse the light evenly. Many of the higher end flood lights will also have multiple leds. Great for indoor use to light up a room or short-range use outdoors to light up an area.</li>
  </ul></li>
