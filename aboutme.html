            <div class="col-lg justify-content align-self-center"><h1>about the site</h1><p>While modern production has made many items affordable and accessible for the masses, it has also come at a cost. Many companies have turned their focus from creating quality products to uninspired, disposable, and cheaply made items that fill our homes and landfills. This website is focused on products and innovations that defy that mindset. Bespoke products are items made for a particular customer or use. Whether you are looking to buy products that enrich your life or have fun building/prototyping them, you have come to the right place. This site mainly focuses on the following criteria: Designed to last a long time. Custom made and tailored towards your needs and enjoyment. The ability to be repaired and enhanced.

Taking products or processes that are the current standard and seeing if there is a way to make them better. <br> Bespoke and enthusiast products that are made with the functionality and the user in mind. Everyone is unique and so are their needs, so why not own products that not only meet those needs, but exceed them. Over the past few years, I've joined and contributed to many to enthusiast communities in search of creating unique purpose built products. My interests include: Bicycles, flashlights, mechanical keyboards, EDC (Everyday Carry), gaming, woodworking, construction, 3d printing, coding and more!</p>

                Since getting started with mechanical keyboards in 2014, I've built tons of keyboards and met many who share the same passion. Designing, prototyping,  testing, tuning, building, restoring keyboards got me interested in mechanical keyboards initially, but it's the community and sharing knowledge that has kept me involved. I have found that there are a lot of great ideas and guides in the community, but they were either hard to find, outdated, or assumed too much prior technical knowledge. A big part of this site is to demystify the mechanical keyboard hobby with honest reviews and guides that anyone can follow.</p></div>
