        <h2>Why Keyboards?</h2>
        <p>Think about it. If you work or play games on a computer, you use your keyboard all day, every day. The peripheral you touch the most is the keyboard. That means your keyboard is one of your most-used possessions. If you use a tool for 8+ hours a day, shouldn’t it be good quality? Doesn’t it make sense to invest in one that can not only improves the experience of typing, but also can enhance your workflow? Mechanical keyboards can do just that and more!</p>
      </div>
      <div id="section1" class="scrollcontent">
        <h2>Membrane vs Mechanical Keyboards</h2>
        <p>Membrane Keyboards utilize a flexible rubber membrane layer beneath the keys. When you press a key, it causes the membrane to press down and make contact with a bottom layer. This allows current to flow “closing” the switch so that the parent device registers the keypress. This means you have to completely depress the key, also known as “bottoming out.” This causes over-exertion and finger/hand fatigue that can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Today’s rubber domes tend to be produced as cheaply as possibe with weak frames, loose tolerances, or cheap materials; resulting in a poor typing experience and unreliable build quality.<br>Mechanical keyboards, however, use a switch underneath every key. Depending on the type of switch, they have a variety of response and travel times. So what does this mean and why would you want to invest in one?</p>

      <div id="section2" class="scrollcontent">
        <h2>Mechanical Keyboard Pros/Cons</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Faster and more precise input:</b> If you use your keyboard mostly for typing, you will likely want to select a clicky or tactile mechanical keyboard. Physiologically, clickiness and tactility promote typing rhythm, speed, and accuracy. Precision switches permit a lighter touch than squishy rubber domes, speeding you up even more and reducing the chances of repetitive stress injury. Similarly, if you use your keyboard for gaming, you will benefit from the faster, more precise input offered by gaming-centric (often linear) switches.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Longevity:</b> The switches on a mechanical keyboard are much more durable than the rubber-dome-over-membrane construction found in mass-produced keyboards. At minimum, they can withstand tens of millions of keystrokes. If one key starts to act up, you can just replace that switch–you don’t have to junk the whole keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Appearance and Customizability:</b> Most mass-produced keyboards look like what they are: unremarkable hunks of plastic. In contrast, mechanical keyboards tend to be more aesthetically pleasing–more like something you’d actually want to put on your desk. Plus, you can easily customize your mechanical keyboard’s appearance by purchasing aftermarket keycaps sets and other accessories.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Desk Space and Ergonomics:</b> Mechanical keyboards come in a variety of form factors, including smaller sizes such as tenkeyless and 60%. These slim designs are easier to center relative to your body and occupy much less space on your desk. They also allow you to bring your mouse closer to your body, which many people find beneficial for shoulder and other joint health.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Zen:</b> Simply put, mechanical keyboards feel good and are fun to use. Many people even find that they promote relaxation. For me, having a mechanical keyboard turns typing from a mundane, unremarkable task to a pleasurable activity I enjoy. Mechanical keyboards make computer work more fun.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>N-Key Rollover:</b> A mechanical keyboard have the capability to register all keys at one time, also known as full N-Key Rollover. This is helpful for folks who type really fast and need to be able to hit keys in quick succession. Gamers who need to mash key combos quickly to frag their enemy also benefit.</li>

        <h2>Switches</h2>
          <p>Switches plays a key role in the overall typing experience. They determine how the keys feel when being pressed and can affect the sound of typing as well.</p>

        <!-- NOTE: switches row -->

            <div class="col-xl-3 mx-auto"><img src="Images\IntroKB Switch- Linear.gif" alt="Linear Gif" style= "width:200px;200px;"></div>
            <div class="col-xl-9 justify-content align-self-center"><h4>Linear</h4><p>Linear switches are a smooth from the top of the switch to the bottom of the key press. Linear switches will get progressively stiffer as the stem gets pushed further down. Linear switches have been popular withing the PC gaming community for their ability to be quickly pressed and double tapped.

            <div class="col-xl-3 mx-auto"><img src="Images\IntroKB Switch- Tactile.gif" alt="Tactile Gif" style= "width:200px;200px;"></div>
            <div class="col-xl-9 justify-content align-self-center"><h4>Tactile</h4><p>Tactile switches have a "bump" part way through the key press. This allows for the typist to have physical feedback as to when the switch is being activated. They are the most common switch and very popular in office settings.

                </p></div>

            <div class="col-xl-3 mx-auto"><img src="Images\IntroKB Switch- Clicky.gif" alt="Clicky Gif" style= "width:200px;200px;"></div>
            <div class="col-xl-9 justify-content align-self-center"><h4>Clicky</h4><p>Clicky switches are designed to emit a sound when actuating. All keystrokes will make a sound when the stem hits the bottom of the switch (bottoming out). Clicky switches have make a deliberate sound to notify the typist that the switch has been activated. In addition to the auditory feedback, all clicky switches have a tactile bump as well. These are great for typing, but are not as popular for gamers and office spaces due to the noise level.

      <div id="section4" class="scrollcontent">
        <h2>Layouts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Full size/100%</b>The most recognizable mechanical keyboard form factor is the full size. The main idea behind this form factor is that it leaves nothing out, which makes it a perfect candidate for those who don’t really know their preferences yet. You get dedicated access to everything a keyboard can offer, such as the arrow keys, function row and number pad. This form factor is a brilliant choice if you absolutely need a number pad.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><b>TKL / Tenkeyless / 80%</b> Tenkeyless is the first step down the form factor ladder, sacrificing the numpad for better ergonomics and extra space on your desk. The smaller footprint of the TKL size allows you to place your mouse more centered to your body, reducing arm and shoulder strain. It's also highly popular in the PC-gaming community, because it gives way to a large amount of space to use your mouse. The tenkeyless form factor is usually the optimal trade-off between form and function.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><b>65%</b> Most mass-produced keyboards look like what they are: unremarkable hunks of plastic. In contrast, mechanical keyboards tend to be more aesthetically pleasing–more like something you’d actually want to put on your desk. Plus, you can easily customize your mechanical keyboard’s appearance by purchasing aftermarket keycaps sets and other accessories.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><b>60%</b> 60% keyboards are even more minimalistic than their TKL counterparts with about 61 keys. They offer significant space and weight savings — they’re easy to carry back and forth to the office, or in conjunction with a proper carrying case, to carry in a backpack. You can center them relative to your body even better than tenkeyless keyboards. Keyboards this size and smaller rely heavily on secondary key layers — to access missing keys, you have to hold down a modifier key in combination with another key. This opens up a whole new workflow with programmable keys and macros. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Notable Mentions</b> There are many other layouts, from ergonomic keyboards, battleship keyboards (bigger than 100%) to 40% keyboards to macropads. Having so much variety in layouts means there is a keyboard to meet the needs of many different preferences and uses.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="section5" class="scrollcontent">
        <h2>Features and Customization</h2>
        <p>Keyboards do not only come in all kinds of shapes and sizes, they also can built to express ones unique aesthetic and provide a custom typing experience.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keycaps: Keycaps come in a variety of colors, profiles (shapes), thicknesses, and materials.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>LED/RGB: LEDs and RGB can completely change the look of your keyboard and your overall desk setup. Depending on the keycaps, it can also make it easier to type at night.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Case Materials: A majority of the keyboards on the market are injection molded plastic, resulting in a hollow and pingy typing sound. Mechanical keyboard housings can be built in not only a large variety of materials, but also numerous finishes and colors. The weight and material of a keyboard can greatly affect how a keyboard sounds and feels.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Programmability: Have you ever thought, I never use [Insert key here], I'd rather it be [Insert key here]? Or I type this same sentence or group of keys everyday? Why doesn't my keyboard have a button to open the calculator or change the volume? Well you are in luck. Many mechanical keyboards are programmable. You can change the characteristics of any key and even create macros to make your workflow more efficient.</li>
